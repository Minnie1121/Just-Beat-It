# Just-Beat-It

   It's a rhythm game where users can generate their own beats according to the music they input by key-pressing. Then the game will draw circles, lines or other patterns for the users to click on or drag. The score goes up as the users hit those patterns right at the beats. The users can create multiple patterns for each song. The goal of the game is to let the users take part in the process of creating patterns, explore music and have fun. 
   
   After I reach the MVP, the game might involve multi-player mode or beat detection from songs such that it can draw patterns for the users to play in real time as the song is playing.
