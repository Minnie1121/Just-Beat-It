# Just-Beat-It

   It's a rhythm game where users can generate their own beats according to the music they input by key-pressing. Then the game will draw different combinations of circles and lines for the users to click on or drag. The score goes up as the users hit those patterns right at the beats. The goal of the game is to let the users take part in the process of creating patterns, enjoy music and have fun. 

## How to run it
   
   You need to "pip install pygame" first.
   Open the GUI file and execute displayGame.py. Then have fun playing the game!
